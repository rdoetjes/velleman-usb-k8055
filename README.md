k8055(N) / VM110(N)
=====
Velleman k8055(N) or VM110(N) linux driver and GUI sources built and tested specifically 
for the Raspberry Pi [Debian Wheezy, 3.6.11+ #348 armv6l GNU/Linux].

From http://libk8055.sourceforge.net :

>"This software allows access to Velleman's K8055 card. This software was
developed to replace all other half-complete softwares for the k8055 board
under Linux. The library is made from scratch with the same functions as
described in Velleman's DLL usermanual. The command line tool is developed from
Julien Etelain and Edward Nys code.

>The reason for writing another driver for Linux was to get the debounce time to
work correctly. Nobody seemed to have figured out how it works (nor did
Velleman care to explain) so I studied it and have it working now with +-4%
accuracy of the actual settime. Note that the Velleman's DLL doesn't even get
this close.

>Another reason was to make it simple to use by writing a library for the k8055,
libk8055. Just by using "#include <k8055.h>" and compiling with "-lk8055" flags
you have access to all the functions described in Velleman's DLL documentation.

>The library is now also available in python, thanks to Pjetur G. Hjaltason.
Included with the source and some examples as well!

>Developer : Sven Lindberg <k8055@mrbrain.mine.nu> (python by Pjetur G.
Hjaltason <pjetur@pjetur.net>)"

How to build & install
----------------------
Install pre-requisites as follows, and build:

    $ sudo apt-get install git python-dev libusb-dev swig libwxgtk2.8-dev
    $ git clone https://github.com/rm-hull/k8055.git
    $ cd k8055
    $ make all
    $ sudo make install
    $ make pylib k8055gui
    $ sudo make pyinstall guiinstall

Usage
-----
Plug in the K8055 board, observe that the power LED is illuminated and at the command-line,
check that the device is recognised:

    $ dmesg | grep Velleman
    [ 4508.616155] usb 1-1.2: Manufacturer: Velleman 
    [ 4508.631260] hid-generic 0003:10CF:5500.0001: hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.00 Device [Velleman  USB K8055] on usb-bcm2708_usb-1.2/input0

Then invoke the **k8055** command with elevated privileges (root permission is needed for 
udev access):

    $ sudo k8055 -debug -d:147
    Parameters : Card=0 Analog1=-1 Analog2=-1 Digital=147
    Velleman Device Found @ Address 005 Vendor 0x010cf Product ID 0x05500
    Get driver name: - could not get bound driver: No data available
    Found interface 0
    Took over the device
    Set digital:147=>0
    25;0;89;118;0;11

This should switch on digital LEDs 1, 2, 5 and 8. See the [manual](https://github.com/rm-hull/k8055/blob/master/MANUAL.md)
page for more details.

Alternatively, use [setuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid) sticky bits to always 
run k8055 with root permissions:

    $ chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/k8055

The GTK gui must also be executed with root permissions, but GTK doesn't allow setuid, so 
start the gui using:

    $ gksu k8055gui

And providing an X display is present, the following dialog will be displayed:

If you experience an error message when trying to run the k8055gui: **error while loading 
shared libraries ..... cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.** then try:

    $ sudo ldconfig -v

to force a rescan of the shared libraries (as reported in issue [#1](https://github.com/rm-hull/k8055/issues/1)) and retry starting 
the gui again.

udev Rules
----------
If you do not want to (or cannot) run the command line or gui with sudo permissions, then 
copy the `velleman.rules` files to `/etc/udev/rules.d`, and create a group called *k8055*
and assign to those users who should have access.


    $ sudo groupadd k8055
    $ sudo usermod -a -G k8055 `whoami` # granting access to the usb board for the local user
    $ sudo reboot
    $ groups # check that the current user has the group k8055, now you can access the board.

Bugs
----
The **k8055gui** does not appear to properly set the digital outs.
